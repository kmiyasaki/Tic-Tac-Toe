# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a program that allows 1-2 users to play Tic-Tac-Toe. This game can be ran on a single computer or on 2 separate computers, where the program uses sockets to connect players via host and port info. Upon running both player1 and player2 files, ensure that player 1 matches the host and port information of player 2 for a connection to be made. 

The board is printed into the shell output for both players, and each player takes turns to make moves on the board. Once a player makes a move using the prompts, the move is sent to the other player. At the end of a game, stats are printed based on the number of games played, and player 1 can choose to play another game.

This program was made using Python and can be ran successfully on IDLE with Python 3.10 installed. Before running, ensure that all participating computers have **gameboard.py** and **socket.py** downloaded, along with either **player1.py** or **player2.py**. If the game is being played on a single computer, ensure both files are downloaded.
